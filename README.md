# War
This contains a java project created in an introduction to java college course in the Spring of 2021. 
The four files that were utilized for this project were put into a package named "cardGame."

1. Card.java        - This file establishes what operates as a card for this project. 
2. Deck.java        - Establishes a 52 card deck of four suits, and established methods such as shuffling for realism. 
3. DeckTest.java    - Utilizes several tests to make sure that the Deck.java file is working as expected. 
4. War.java         - Lastly, this file sets up the card game "War" and provides the user with some level of interaction within the execution of the file. 

File 1 (Card.java) was provided by the professor who was teaching the course, while files 2, 3, and 4 were created mainly independently, with some troubleshooting advice and feedback provided.
